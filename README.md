Game directory is the one I deposited to Github and it is connected to github desktop.
So, I can copy or add or change anything in that directory and open the github desktop, commit changes and push everything to origin.


The laymen annotation handling is Annotations directory.

Online_Game is the offline version and it has only 100 images from each channel. The main 500 images version is on Lunarc.
